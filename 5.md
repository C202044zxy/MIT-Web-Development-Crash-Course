## Async / Await

An `async` function is a function that returns a promise. Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` key word to wait for a promise to resolve. 

The `await` operator is used to wait for a promise. It can only be used inside an `async` function. When an `await` operator is used, it pauses the execution of the `async` function and waits for the promise to resolve or reject. 

The following code snippet performs a get request in useEffect: 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  get("api/stories").then((storyObjs) => {
  	setStories(storyObjs); 
  })
}, []);
```

Now, rewrite it using `async` and `await` notation: 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const getStories = async () => {
  	const storyObjs = await get("api/stories");
  	setStories(storyObjs); 
  }
  getStories(); 
}, []); 
```

## Database

Database is a system that stores data in an organized manner, which is generally optimized and failure proof. It supports creation, deletion, reading and updating data vis DBMS(Database Management System). We will use Mongo database. 

Here is the MongoDB structure in words: 

- Database (e.g. Catbook database): a group of collections, generally corresponds to one web application. 
- Collection (e.g. Stories collection): a group of very similar pieces of data. Ideally want all data in a given collection to have the same structure. 
- Document (e.g. Data for a single story): a single JSON or JavaScript object. A single piece of data in the the application. 
- Field (e.g. content property for a single story): an attribute we want to record the value of, a key of the JavaScript object.

Schemas define the structure of your document. Here is a code snippet that defines a comment schema for the database. 

```javascript
const Comment = new mongoose.Schema({
  creator_name: String,
  parent: String, 
  content: String,
});
```

Get and post request in API: 

```javascript
router.get("/comment", (req, res) => {
  // for get request, you can find info in req.query
  Comment.find({ parent: req.query.parent }).then((comments) => {
    res.send(comments);
  });
  // find all the comments whose parent = req.query.parent
  // and send the response.
});

router.post("/comment", (req, res) => {
  // for post request, you can find info in req.body
  const newComment = new Comment({
    creator_name: myName,
    parent: req.body.parent,
    content: req.body.content,
  }); // create a document instance via Schema
  newComment.save().then((comment) => res.send(comment));
  // save the data into database and send the response. 
});
```
