## React

**Component**

React is a Framework that lets you divide up your website into reusable components. Each component is like a custom HTML tag you defined. 

Components are an abstraction of a bunch of HTML / CSS / JavaScript. The components can be structured into tree hierarchy. 

**Props and State**

Props allow us to create reusable components - render a skeleton with custom content. Props are passed in from the parents only.

State lets us control what is displayed in the application. State can be **updated** (i.e. is **mutable** unlike props) by either **human** inputs (e.g. button clicks) or **computer** inputs (e.g. network responses) . 

Here is the instance of create a state of car happiness: 

```javascript
const [catHappiness, setCatHappiness] = useState(0);
// catHappiness: the current state value, initialized to 0.
// setCatHappiness: a function that you can call to update the state.
const incrementCatHappiness = () => {
	setCatHappiness(catHappiness + 1);
    // increase the cat happiness by one
    // must use the pre-defined set function
};
```

**Implementation**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react"; // import React library. 
const Profile = (props) => { // define components
	// function logic (JavaScript)
	return (
        // What you want to render. 
        // React uses className instead of class for css styles
    );
};
export default Profile; // export components
```

**Lifecycle**

Component rendering works like restaurant: 

- Trigger: First time the component is called or state change. 
- Render: React runs the JavaScript code and called the subcomponents. 
- Commit: React puts returned JSX into HTML DOC to be served to user. 

**useEffect Hook**

If we want to do something immediately after state is changed, we need a new React feature for this: useEffect hook. 

It runs after specific variables change, which is typically used to synchronize with something external to React. Here is some detailed examples: 

```javascript
// calls every time var1 or var2 changes. 
useEffect(myFunction, [var1, var2]);

// Calls myFunction only once when the component is rendered for the first time (on mount). 
useEffect(myFunction, []);

// Calls myFunction at every render. 
useEffect(myFunction); 
```

Returning a function from the function passed to useEffect lets you define something that happens on component dismount. 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
	/*
		Do something here. 
		e.g. interacting with external service. 
	*/
    return () => {
        /*
        	Cleanup function.
        	e.g. disconnecting with external service. 
        */
    }
}, [/* dependencies */])
```
