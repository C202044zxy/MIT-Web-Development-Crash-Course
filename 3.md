## API

### Concept

| Name     | Explanation                                   |
| :------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | Part that users directly interact with        |
| Backend  | Data storage & data manipulation              |
| Clients  | Your browser                                  |
| Server   | The device that holds your site's information |

HTTP is short for *Hypertext Transfer Protocol*. HTTPS means HTTP secure. 

### Request

A HTTP request is a way for a client to ask a server for a resources or data. Here is the basic structure of a HTTP request: 

<img src = "C:\Users\16549\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240716194417454.png" width = 300>

Target URL and query parameters are common in our real life. For example: 

```javascript
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=web+lab
// Protocol : HTTPS | URL(Uniform Resource Locator) of the Server
// Query Params: 
// {
// 	search_query=web+lab
// }
```

When you visit this URL, you’ll see a list of YouTube videos related to web lab. 

HTTP methods indicate the desired function: 

| Method | Function                    |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| GET    | gets data                   |
| POST   | sends data & creates change |
| PUT    | replaces data               |
| DELETE | deletes data                |

### Endpoints

By accessing a URL, you are making a request to an endpoint. Multiple endpoints can exist under the same URL, but are differentiated based on the type of request. 

### Promise

Get and Post functions are creating by JavaScript fetch method: 

```javascript
const user = get('/api/getUserByNumber', {
	phoneNumber: 114514,
});
// send a get request to /api/getUserByNumber?phoneNumber=114154
```

If I try `console.log(user)`, I don't get anything except `[object Promise]`. You can use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle Promise object. 

```javascript
const user = get('/api/getUserByNumber', { phoneNumber: 114514,
}).then((storyObjs) => {
    setStories(storyObjs); 
}).catch((err) => {
    console.log("this is so sad: ", err.message); 
}); 
// Once promise is fulfilled, do stuff in .then()
// Once promise is rejected, do stuff in .catch()
```

Promises allow for asynchronous processing. Things like calling an API takes time so Promises don’t hold things up.
